\title{Generate missing data based on the observed patterns in the real dataset.}
\usage{
missingObserved(
  dataset,
  count.variable = "Count",
  observed.variable = "Observed",
  site.variable = "Site",
  year.variable = "Year",
  period.variable = "Period"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A dataset to a the observation with missing data.}

\item{count.variable}{The name of the variable holding the counts.}

\item{observed.variable}{The name of the variable holding the observed values
= either count or missing.}

\item{site.variable}{The name of the variable holding the sites.}

\item{year.variable}{The name of the variable holding the years.}

\item{period.variable}{The name of the variable holding the period.}
}
\description{
The observed values will be either equal to the counts or missing.
The probability of missing is the inverse of the counts + 1.
